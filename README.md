Front End Capstone - "Camp S'More"

## Motivation

I wanted to create an application that will help those who like camping and want to easily search for a camp ground and make reservations, as well as have a message board to communicate with other campers. I really enjoy the outdoors, hiking and camping, and although there are already a ton of other apps already created about the same, I enjoyed making my own version and hope that other campers could find it useful to them.

This Application was created with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS
External API was utilized in the CampGround list and search function in the app with National Parks Service (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm)
