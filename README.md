### Motivation

Camp S'More was created to help outdoor lovers easily search for campgrounds, make reservations, and connect with fellow campers through a message board. I designed this app to combine my passion for hiking and the outdoors with love of building meaningful user experiences.

This project was originally developed during my time at Nashville Software School, and as of May 2025, I've revisited it to refelect my growth as a developer and reignite my excitement for personal projects.
